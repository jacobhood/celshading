    </h2>
    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
    <p>We want to implement shading techniques that allow for the rendering of non-photorealistic images based on 3D models. Though sharing the general approach of the photorealistic shading techniques we implemented in previous projects, some subtle adjustments to these techniques are required to render images in a deliberately unrealistic, cartoonish style.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
    <p>We will start with the same “raw materials” as we do with photorealistic shading―a 3D model from which we can extract information about surface normals, intersections with light rays, material properties, and so on. The diffuse, Blinn-Phong, or texture map-based shading methods used in project 3-2 will not suffice for this task; instead, the shading method we use must use surface normal information and proximity to light sources to color the surface in strictly lighter or darker shades of a given color, which as pictured below give the image the appearance of being drawn by hand, when it was in fact rendered from the same kind of mesh we have shaded with photorealistic techniques. This general approach to shading is known as cel shading.</p>
        <p>We are trying to simulate the visual appearance of a hand-drawn cartoon style image using cel shading. This approach is used in frequently in video games and cartoons to give the appearance of a comic or cartoon without having to hand-draw animations frame-by-frame. Examples of technique in video games include Ōkami and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is also used in television shows Knights of Sidonia and Archer. Cel shading simulates this visual style by discretizing transitions between light and dark areas rather than a smooth transition. The second component of this will be to trace outlines of the 3D model. This simulates the outlines that are typically found in cartoons or comics. The challenge for this part will be detecting edges and also creating convincing renders of the outlines. These outlines should vary in thickness depending on the lighting or texture of the subject.</p>
        
    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p>1. What we plan to deliver:</p>
        <p>One potential pitfall of this approach would be creating a posterized look rather than a hand-drawn look.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to implement cel shading in a way that produces aesthetically pleasing, cartoon-style images from 3D scenes. Our shading should also work in conjunction with texture mapping to allow for textured surfaces.
        The user should be able to view the scene from a variety of angles, and interactively move the camera around using the keyboard and mouse.
        We expect real-time performance of around 30 frames/second, using the WebGL framework provided for project 3-2.
        If we finish our initial goals ahead of schedule, we plan to also implement X-Toon shading (Barla, P., Thollot, J., and Markosian, L. 2006) to add specular highlighting and backlighting to our scenes. We should produce results similar to those seen in this video.

        <p>2. What we hope to deliver:</p>
        <p>If all goes well, we hope to implment an adaptive outline detection algorithm that will draw outlines of varying thickness depending on the lighting conditions to more accurately simulate hand-drawn outlines. For example, outlines for unlit areas are usually heavier than they are for brightly lit areas.</p>
